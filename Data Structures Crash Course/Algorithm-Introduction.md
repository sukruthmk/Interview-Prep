# Algorithm Introduction

Set of instructions used to solve a problem



### Pseudocode

short code to explain an algorithm

Ex:- for finding the max element in an array

Array = [2, 5, 1, 8, 9, 6]

```
A = [list of numbers]
max_element = A[0]
for each number in A:
 if number > max_element
 	max_element = number
```



### What is a data structure?
